.SH DESRIPTION
.B todo
is a simple, minimalist todo list manager. Users can
add items to a todo list or delete them. Deleted items
are archived and can be reviewed.
.PP
The default location of the todo list can be set with
the
.B TODO
environment variable. If unset, a the default file is
.B ~/todo.txt.
.PP
If
.B todo
is used within a tmux session, the filename of the todo
list inherits the name of the current session. This
allows for unique todo lists based on tmux context.
.PP
The options are as follows:

.TP
.B -a " quoted_todo_item"
Add a new todo list item

.BI -d " item_number_or_phrase"
Delete a todo list item by its number or by a string.
If a string is provided, any todo list item that matches
that string will be removed. Deleted items are moved
to the archive.
.PP
The archive file is named identically to the todo file
with the exception of a
.B .archive
added before the extension. For example, todo.txt would
have an archive named todo.archive.txt in the same folder.
.TP
.B -x
Display the archive file.
.TP
.B -v
Display current version information.
